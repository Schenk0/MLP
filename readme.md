# Neural Network Implementation for SOP

This repository contains a custom implementation of a neural network from scratch for the SOP assignment. The neural network is designed to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Setup
- Run `python -m venv venv`
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Run 
To run use the following commands.

- Run `.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
- Run `python run-test.py`

## To-Do
- [ ] Implement mini-batch training
- [ ] Implement cross entropy loss function
